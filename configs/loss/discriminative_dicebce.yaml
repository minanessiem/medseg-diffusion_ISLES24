# Pure segmentation loss for discriminative models.
# No diffusion/MSE component - direct mask supervision.
#
# Loss configuration follows the same pattern as auxiliary_losses:
# - Each loss has an 'enabled' flag to turn it on/off
# - Weight controls contribution (0.0 to 1.0)
# - Can use dice only, bce only, or both together
#
# Total loss: L = dice_weight * Dice + bce_weight * BCE

# Primary loss type (set to NONE - no diffusion loss used)
loss_type: NONE

# Auxiliary losses section (required by openai_adapter, ignored by discriminative)
# Keep disabled to avoid confusion
auxiliary_losses:
  enabled: false
  diffusion_weight: 0.0
  dice:
    enabled: false
    weight: 0.0
    smooth: 1.0e-5
    apply_sigmoid: false
  bce:
    enabled: false
    weight: 0.0
    pos_weight: null
    apply_sigmoid: false
  calibration:
    enabled: false
    weight: 0.0
