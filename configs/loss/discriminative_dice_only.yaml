# Dice-only loss for discriminative models.
# Use when BCE causes training instability or for class-imbalanced data.
#
# Dice loss is better for:
# - Highly imbalanced datasets (small lesions)
# - When precise boundary detection is less critical
# - Avoiding pixel-wise loss saturation issues

defaults:
  - discriminative_dicebce

# Override: disable BCE, keep only Dice
