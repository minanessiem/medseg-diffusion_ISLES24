# Discriminative (non-diffusion) training mode.
# Model directly predicts segmentation mask from input modalities.
# No noise, no timesteps, no iterative denoising.
#
# Use with discriminative models like SwinUNETR that perform
# single forward pass segmentation.

type: Discriminative

# Dummy value for interface compatibility (unused)
timesteps: 1
