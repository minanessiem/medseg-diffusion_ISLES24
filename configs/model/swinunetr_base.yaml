# MONAI SwinUNETR for discriminative 2D segmentation.
#
# Key differences from diffusion models (DiffSwinTr, MedSegDiff):
# - NO time conditioning (no timestep input)
# - NO mask concatenation (input is modalities only)
# - Direct mask prediction (not noise prediction)
#
# Input: modalities only [B, image_channels, H, W]
# Output: binary segmentation mask [B, out_channels, H, W]
#
# Parameters: ~62M (with default settings)

architecture: swinunetr

# ==================== Core Dimensions ====================
image_size: 256
image_channels: ${dataset.num_modalities}  # Dynamic based on dataset (e.g., 2 for CBF+TMAX)
out_channels: 1                             # Binary segmentation

# ==================== SwinUNETR Architecture ====================
# Feature dimension (similar to embed_dim in Swin Transformer)
feature_size: 48

# Number of Swin blocks per encoder stage
# Standard Swin-T style: [2, 2, 2, 2]
depths: [2, 2, 2, 2]

# Number of attention heads per stage (increases with feature dimension)
num_heads: [3, 6, 12, 24]

# ==================== Regularization ====================
